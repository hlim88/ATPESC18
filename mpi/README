Examples for the advanced MPI class, 2017.

2-D decomposition examples, with variations for different send modes.
Designed to permit running multiple methods in a simple program to
simplify comparison tests.

There are versions in C and in Fortran 2003, in code-examples-c and
code-examples-f9x respectively.

Based on the 2-d Life code, but with some changes.

Building the examples
---------------------
The "configure" script should be used to create the Makefiles.  It will often be
able to determine the compilers needed for MPI programs, but if not, specify
the compiler for C programs using MPICC and for Fortran programs with MPIFORT.
For example, on the Blue Waters system, a Cray XE6/XK7 system, this configure
line is used:

    ./configure MPICC=cc MPIFORT=ftn

cd to either code-examples-c (for the C examples) or code-examples-f9x (for
the Fortran examples) and run make.

Running the examples
--------------------
In each code directory, the script "runexample" submits a job that runs the
script "sampleruns" to the batch queue for vesta.  Modify these scripts to
change the system on which the run is made and the specifics of the runs
performed.
