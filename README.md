This repository contains activities during ATPESC (Argonne Training Program for Extreme Scale Computing). 

Many of codes came from during hands-on exerciese and some of solutions are written during the training.

Most of code can run with ALCF (Argonne Leadership Computing Facility) machines including Mira, Theta, and Cooley. Other architectures may need to change compliers/codes to compile/run it.

Codes are written in various languages but mostly based on C and C++.
